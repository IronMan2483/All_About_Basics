    "# Introduction to if-Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand the logic behind if-statement\n",
    "- know the syntax of if-statements (if, elif, else; nested if statements (and or and not))\n",
    "- use comparison operators and define boolean variables\n",
    "- integrate users input with the function input()\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to control the flow of your Python program is with an `if` statement. From a high level, an `if` statement allows us to check whether or not a certain condition is true. If it is, certain operations will be performed. Otherwise, those operations will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we're asked to write a program that takes a bunch of numbers and gives back to us those that are even. We would need to write an `if` statement that identifies whether or not a number is even (we'll talk later about how to do this), and then give back only those that meet the even condition. This is a program that will be entirely within our ability to implement at the end of next week; for now, though, let's focus on the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of an `if` statement in Python is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    if_block_statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the `if` statement, after the condition, ends in a colon `:`. This is the way that Python declares the start of an indentation block. The purposes of indentation blocks manifest themselves in many different ways. With our `if` statement, just know that they mark a section of code that is run under specific circumstances, when the codition is true. What does it mean, then, for a condition to be true? To understand this, let's look at conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's tackle this one part at a time. What does it mean to be a condition? Really, all an `if` is checking is whether the conditional evaluates to `True` or `False`. In english, it checks if the condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the body of the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is false, the `if` block is skipped. Intuitively, true and false are concepts that make perfect sense to us. But, we should take the time to clearly define them in a programming context.\n",
    "\n",
    "`True` and `False` are what we call booleans in logic, and what Python calls them (`bool` for short). They are a special variable type with many potential uses; mainly they are used as a way to put a label on the truth of a statement. There are two specifically reserved words for bools in Python, `True` and `False`. Note that these begin with capital letters."

    "We can see that what this **nested** `if` statement is checking is if `x` is greater than 5, and if so, then the conditional block is entered. Next, it checks if `x` is less than 10, and if this is true `x` is printed. We can intuitively guess that there is a better way to check for this condition... And there is!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python gives us full access to what are known as boolean operations. The ones that we will use most often are `and`, `or`, and `not`. Both `and` and `or` take two conditions as inputs, while `not` takes only a single condition. All of these operations return a single boolean. `and` requires both conditions to be `True` to return `True`, otherwise it will return `False`. `or` requires only one of the conditions to be `True` to return `True`; the only time it returns `False` is when both inputs are `False`. The `not` switches the truth of the input condition. These operations are derived from formal logic, and you can find a full discussion of their intricacies [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that we now have a natural way to combine conditions. The previously nested `if` statement can now be written as a simple `if x > 5 and x < 10`. We can also chain other interesting conditionals together. Change the value of `x` in the next cell so that it isn't printed and in the cell after so that it is."
